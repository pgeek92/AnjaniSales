•	ADMIN can reject or approve new registration request of user and if reject then ADMIN has to mention comment why he is rejecting his request

•	ADMIN can update SALES_TRANSACTION, CASH_TRANSACTION details of previous two days only(because daily a lot of transactions are there)

USER can add SALES_TRANSACTION details based on below scenarios
•	If a PARTY purchase ITEM from us directly then no BROKER will be present in this case then BASIC_AMOUNT = RATE * QUANTITY, TOTAL_AMOUNT = BASIC_AMOUNT + COMMISSION + MAZDOORI + BARDAANA, TOTAL_AMOUNT will be TOTAL_OUTSTANDING amount in PARTY_DETAILS will be saved
•	If a PARTY purchase ITEM from us through BROKER, then BROKER will be present in this case then BASIC_AMOUNT = RATE * QUANTITY,
BROKERAGE_AMOUNT = BASIC_AMOUNT * BROKERAGE_PERCENTAGE (will be entered manually by USER)
 TOTAL_AMOUNT = BASIC_AMOUNT + COMMISSION + MAZDOORI + BARDAANA, TOTAL_AMOUNT will be TOTAL_OUTSTANDING amount in PARTY_DETAILS will be saved and BROKERAGE_AMOUNT will be AMOUNT_REMAINING amount in BROKER_DETAILS will be saved 
USER can add CASH_TRANSACTION based on below scenarios.
•	There are four types of transactions in case of CREDIT
1.	CASH_SALE (It can be achieved by two methods)
a)	Either party directly purchase from us in cash
then this entry will be present in CREDIT side of CASH_TRANSACTION
b)	Or party purchase from us in cash through BROKER then this entry will be present in CREDIT side of CASH_TRANSACTION and BROKERAGE_AMOUNT as AMOUNT_REMAINING will be saved into BROKER_DETAILS towards this BROKER
2.	PAYMENT_FROM_PARTY(It can be achieved by three methods)
            a) Either party give payment through cash then this entry 
                 will be present in CREDIT side of CASH_TRANSACTION 
                 and TOTAL_OUTSTANDING will be updated in
                 PARTY_DETAILS
            b) or party give payment through CHEQUE then this entry
                 will be present in CREDIT and DEBIT side both (it means
                 party amount is credited and deposited to BANK and 
                 TOTAL_OUTSTANDING will be updated in
                 PARTY_DETAILS)
                 there may be a case in this scenario of CHEQUE, if after 
                 some days CHEQUE bounces then whatever amount we 
                 updated in TOTAL_OUTSTANDING in PARTY_DETAILS
                 will again updated   
c)	Or party give payment through NEFT then this entry will be present in both sides CREDIT as well as DEBIT and TOTAL_OUTSTANDING will be updated in PARTY_DETAILS
