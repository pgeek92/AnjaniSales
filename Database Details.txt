POINTS TO BE NOTED FOR IMPLEMENTATION PURPOSE
---------------------------------------------
1. When Admin makes new entry of Party, then if PARTY_NAME and LANDMARK comes same then new entry will be made and we append 'A' or 'B' with this entry
2. Admin can update high sensitive SALES_TRANSACTION table why?(Reason is suppose sales amount is 4000 and user by mistakenly entered 400 rs then Admin has to update this thing)
